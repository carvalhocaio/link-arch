# Claude Agents & Skills

This repository is a collection of reusable Claude Code **agents** and **skills** for software engineering projects. Copy the `.claude/` directory into any project to adopt the full setup.

## Agent workflow

For any implementation task (new feature, bugfix, refactor, or any task that requires writing or modifying code), always invoke the `tech-lead` agent first. It will plan the execution and delegate to the correct specialist agents in the right order.

Do NOT invoke `tech-lead` for:
- `/commit` — run manually when you're ready to commit
- `/pr-description` — run manually when opening a PR
- `/changelog` — run manually when preparing a release
- `/docs` — run manually when documentation changes are needed

## How agents work

Agents are invoked as subagents via the `Task` tool or by calling them by name in Claude Code. Each agent has a focused role and a defined set of tools.

Start complex tasks with `tech-lead` — it will orchestrate the right agents in the right order. For simple tasks, call specialist agents directly.

## How skills work

Skills are invoked with `/skill-name` in the Claude Code prompt. Some skills accept an optional argument: `/commit`, `/review path/to/file`, `/changelog v1.3.0`.

**Convention skills** (`python-conventions`, `nextjs-conventions`, `api-conventions`) are **path-based** — they activate automatically when Claude reads or writes files matching their `paths` patterns. They are never invoked manually.

## Agents

| Agent               | Invoke as       | Role                                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tech-lead`         | subagent / name | Orchestrates complex tasks, delegates, validates gates      |
| `backend-engineer`  | subagent / name | Implements backend code (Python/FastAPI, Go, Node.js)       |
| `frontend-engineer` | subagent / name | Implements frontend code (Next.js, React, TypeScript)       |

## Skills

| Skill              | Invoke as           | Role                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commit`           | `/commit`           | Git commit following Conventional Commits               |
| `review`           | `/review`           | Code review: Clean Code + SOLID, by severity            |
| `security-review`  | `/security-review`  | Security-focused review: injection, auth, data exposure |
| `test`             | `/test`             | Generates or updates tests for changed code             |
| `pr-description`   | `/pr-description`   | Generates a complete PR description                     |
| `changelog`        | `/changelog`        | Generates or updates CHANGELOG.md                       |
| `docs`             | `/docs`             | Generates or updates README and other .md docs          |

## Convention skills (auto-loaded)

| Skill                  | Activates on                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `python-conventions`   | `**/*.py`                                       |
| `nextjs-conventions`   | `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx` (excluding test files)    |
| `api-conventions`      | `**/routes/**`, `**/api/**`, `**/handlers/**`… |

## Recommended flow for a new task

```
tech-lead
  └─ backend-engineer  (implements)
  └─ frontend-engineer (implements, if needed)
  └─ test              (generates tests)
  └─ review            (code quality gate)
  └─ security-review   (if security surface)
  └─ commit            (finalizes commit)
  └─ pr-description    (when opening PR)
```

For releases: `changelog` → `docs` (if needed) → `commit`.
